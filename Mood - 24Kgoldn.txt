Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view
Why you always in a mood?
Fuckin 'round, actin' brand new
I ain't tryna tell you what to do
But try to play it cool
Baby, I ain't playing by your rules
Everything look better with a view

I could never get attached
When I start to feel, I unattach
Somehow I always end up feeling bad
Baby, I am not your dad, it's not all you want from me
I just want your company
Girl, it's obvious, elephant in the room
And we're a part of it, don't act so confused
And you love startin' it, now I'm in a mood
Now we're arguin' in my bedroom

We play games of love to avoid the depression
We've been here before
And I won't be your victim

So why you tryin' to fake your love on the regular
When you could be blowin' up just like my cellular
I won't ever let a shorty go and set me up
Only thing I need to know is if you wet enough
I'm talking slick back, kick back, gang sippin' forties
You keep playing, not another day with you shorty
Mismatched fits, that was way before you know me
Got a lot of love, well you better save it for me
