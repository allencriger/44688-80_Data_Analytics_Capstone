Ladies up in here tonight
No fighting
We got the refugees up in here
No fighting, no fighting

Shakira, Shakira

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? this is perfection

Hey girl, I can see your body moving
And it's driving me crazy
And I didn't have the slightest idea
Until I saw you dancing

And when you walk up on the dance floor
Nobody cannot ignore the way you move your body, girl (Just smooth)
And everything's so unexpected – the way you right and left it
So you can keep on shaking it (Let's go)

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You make a woman go mad
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body
No fighting

I'm on tonight
You know my hips don't lie
No fighting
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Don't you see baby? Así es perfecto

Baby, I know I'm on tonight my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
All the attraction, the tension
Don't you see baby? This is perfection
Shakira, Shakira

Oh boy, I can see your body moving
Half animal, half man
I don't, don't really know what I'm doing
But you seem to have a plan
My will and self-restraint
Have come to fail now, fail now
See, I'm doing what I can, but I can't so you know
That's a bit too hard to explain
(Uno, dos, tres, cuatro)

Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)
Baila en la calle de noche (Uh, yeah)
Baila en la calle de día (Let's go!)

I never really knew that she could dance like this
She make a man wanna speak Spanish
¿Cómo se llama (sí), bonita (sí), mi casa (sí, Shakira Shakira), su casa

Oh baby when you talk like that
You know you got me hypnotized
So be wise (Sí!) and keep on (Sí!)
Reading the signs of my body

Señorita, feel the conga, let me see you move like you come from Colombia
Yeah, oh, yeah, ladies, sí! (Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah)

Mira en Barranquilla se baila así, say it!
Mira en Barranquilla se baila así

Yeah
She's so sexy every man's fantasy a refugee like me back with the Fugees from a third-world country
I go back like when 'pac carried crates for Humpty Humpty
We lead the whole club jazzy
Why the CIA wanna watch us?
Colombians and Haitians
I ain't guilty, it's a musical transaction
Bo-bop-so-bop, no more do we snatch ropes
Refugees run the seas 'cause we own our own boats, boats (No fighting)

I'm on tonight, my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel you boy
Come on let's go, real slow
Baby, like this is perfecto (No fighting)

Oh, you know I'm on tonight and my hips don't lie
And I'm starting to feel it's right
The attraction, the tension
Baby, like this is perfection

No fighting
