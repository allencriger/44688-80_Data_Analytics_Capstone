[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Ooh (Ooh)
Na-na, yeah

[The Weeknd:]
I saw you dancing in a crowded room (Uh)
You look so happy when I'm not with you
But then you saw me, caught you by surprise
A single teardrop falling from your eye

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Oh)

[The Weeknd:]
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another

[The Weeknd (Ariana Grande):]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Mm)

[Ariana Grande:]
Met you once under a Pisces moon
I kept my distance 'cause I know that you
Don't like when I'm with nobody else
I couldn't help it, I put you through hell

I don't know why I run away, oh boy (Run away, oh yeah; oh)
I make you cry when I run away (Away, oh; oh)

Boy, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that it's much too late
And you deserve someone better

Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)

[Both (Ariana Grande):]
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I don't know why I run away (Oh)
(Bum, bum, bum, bum, bum)
I make you cry when I run away (Save)

[Both (Ariana Grande) {The Weeknd}:]
Save your tears for another day (Ooh) oh
{Ooh, girl, I said} (Okay)
{Save} (Save) {your} (Your) {tears for another day} (Oh yeah, yeah) oh

[The Weeknd (Both):]
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day (Oh)
Save your tears for another day
