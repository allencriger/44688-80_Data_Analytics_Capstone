You're an alien

You're so hypnotizing
Could you be the devil
Could you be an angel
Different DNA
They don't understand you

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go lead me into the light

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love
And fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
B-boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial

They say be afraid
They say b-b-b-be afraid
They say b-b-b-be afraid
They say b-b-b-be afraid

You're from a whole other world
A different dimension
You open my eyes
And I'm ready to go lead me into the light

Kiss me, k-k-kiss me
Infect me with your love
And fill me with your poison
Take me, t-t-take me
Wanna be your victim
Ready for abduction
B-boy, you're an alien
Your touch so foreign
It's supernatural
Extra-terrestrial
