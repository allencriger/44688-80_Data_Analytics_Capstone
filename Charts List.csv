They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty

My music so loud
I'm swanging
They hoping that they gon' catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty
Tryna catch me riding dirty

[Chamillionaire:]
Police think they can see me lean
I'm tint so it ain't easy to be seen
Police see me ride by they can see the gleam
And my shine on the deck and the TV screen
Ride with a new chick, she like hold up
Next to the PlayStation controller
Is a full clip and my pistola
Send a jacker into a coma
Girl you ain't know, I'm crazy like Krayzie Bone
Just tryna bone ain't tryna have no babies
Ride clean as hell so I pull in ladies
Law's on patrol and you know they hate me
Music turned all the way up into the maximum
I got speakers, some niggas tryna jack for some
But we packing something and what we have for 'em
We'll have a nigga locked up in a maximum security cell,
I'm gripping oak
Music loud and I'm tipping slow
Twin's steady twisting like hit this dough
Police pull up right behind and it's in his throat
Windows down gotta stop pollution
CD changes niggas like, ""Who is that producing?""
That's the Play-N-Skillz when we out and cruising
Got warrants in every city except Houston but I'm still ain't losing

They see me rolling
They hating
Patrolling they trying to catch me riding dirty

[Krayzie Bone:]
I been drinking and smoking
Holy shit 'cause I really can't focus
I gotta get it home 'fore the po po's scope this
Big old Excursion swerving
All up in the curbing
Nigga be sipping on the Hennessey and the gin again
It's in again, we in the wind
Doing a hundred while I puff on a blunt
And roll another one up, we living like we ain't giving a fuck
I got a blunt up in my right hand,
40 oz in my lap freezing my balls
Roll another tree, green leaves and all
Coming pretty deep, me and my dogs, yo
I gotta get the back streets
Wondering about the six pounds and I got heat
Glock Glock shots to the block we creep creep
Pop Pop hope cops don't see me, on a low key
With no regard for the law we dodge em like fuck em all
But I won't get caught up and brought up on charges for none of y'all
Keep a gun in car, and a blunt to spark,
Roll it up if you want, nigga, get it popping, dog
Ready or not we bust shots off in the air Krayzie Bone and Chamillionaire

[Chamillionaire:]
Now would you think it so? I tried to let you go
Turn on my blinker light and then I swang it slow
And they upset for sure, 'cause they think they know
That they catching me with plenty of the drank and dro
So they get behind me, tryna check my tags
Look in my rear view and they smiling
Thinking they'll catch me in the wrong, they keep trying
Steady denying that it's racial profiling
Houston, Texas, you can check my tags
Pull me over, try to check my slab
Glove compartment, gotta get my cash
'Cause the crooked cops'll try to come up fast
And being the baller that I am, I talk to them
Giving a damn about them not feeling my attitude
When they realize I ain't even riding dirty
Bet you'll be leaving with an even madder mood
I'mma laugh at you and then I'll have to cruise
Yeah, my #2 on some old-school DJ Screw
You can't arrest me, plus you can't sue
This is a message to the law, telling them, ""We hate you.""
I can't be touched and tell 'em that they shoulda known
Tipping down, I'm sitting crooked on my chrome
Bookin' my phone, finding a chick I wanna bone
Like they couldn't stop me I'm 'bout to pull up at your home and it's on

2006,1,Bad Day,Daniel Powter,"Where is the moment we needed the most
You kick up the leaves and the magic is lost
They tell me your blue skies fade to grey
They tell me your passion's gone away
And I don't need no carryin' on

You stand in the line just to hit a new low
You're faking a smile with the coffee to go
You tell me your life's been way off line
You're falling to pieces every time
And I don't need no carryin' on

'Cause you had a bad day
You're taking one down
You sing a sad song just to turn it around
You say you don't know
You tell me don't lie
You work at a smile and you go for a ride
You had a bad day
The camera don't lie
You're coming back down and you really don't mind
You had a bad day

Well, you need a blue sky holiday

There was something so pleasant about that place.
Even your emotions had an echo

I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?

Possibly [radio version]

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice

You really think you're in control

Well, I think you're crazy

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on a limb
And all I remember is thinking, I want to be like them

And I can die when I'm done

2011,3,Firework,Katy Perry,"Do you ever feel like a plastic bag
Drifting through the wind
Wanting to start again?
Do you ever feel, feel so paper-thin
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?

Do you ever feel already buried deep
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing
Do you know that there's still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you?

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

You don't have to feel like a wasted space
You're original, cannot be replaced
If you only knew what the future holds
After a hurricane comes a rainbow

Maybe a reason why all the doors are closed
So you could open one that leads you to the perfect road
Like a lightning bolt your heart will glow
And when it's time you'll know

You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine
Just own the night like the 4th of July

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on, let your colors burst
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""
You're gonna leave 'em all in awe, awe, awe

It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through, -ough, -ough

'Cause, baby, you're a firework
Come on, show 'em what you're worth
Make 'em go, ""Ah, ah, ah""

When we were younger and free

Before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town
Where nothing ever happened?

It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new

But now I'm insecure and I care what people think

My name's 'Blurryface' and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time (oh), to the good old days (oh)
When our momma sang us to sleep but now we're stressed out

We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from
I'd make a candle out of it if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one

It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes homegrown a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree-house homes we all would take the latter
